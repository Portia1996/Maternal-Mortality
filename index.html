        <u> ABSTRACT</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        In Nigeria, maternal mortality remains a public health issue. About 145 women lose their lives in childbirth each day (Piane, 2019). Most of these issues is associated with different factors such as social, unsafe healthcare practices and cultural issues. Even though there has been a considerable progress, there has still been an ongoing issue in healthcare systems to significantly meet women’s needs. Studies have shown that proper maternal care needs to be implemented to ensure the wellbeing of women in Nigeria. however, without proper healthcare systems, the chances of maternal complications occurring becomes higher. This paper thus examines the determinant factors of maternal mortality in Nigeria. it then highlights some of the main nonmedical causes of maternal mortality. This review describes how the lack of appropriate healthcare systems has had a huge impact women's health and wellbeing. Subsequently, the study also seeks to gather different articles containing data on the experiences women face regarding maternal care. Both qualitative and quantitative research were used to conduct this review. The expectation of this review is to better comprehend this ongoing public health problem in Nigeria.

        <b>Maternal Mortality</b> is a term coined to describe unfortunate deaths of mothers due to during or after pregnancy and birth complications; usually happening within a month or two of bringing forth (WHO 2005). According to World Health Organization’s assessments in 2019, there were myriad of notable complications such as bleeding after birth mostly severe, gestational diseases like eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, diabetes, etc., infections and poverty amongst many others that are believed to cause these tragic deaths. A recent study showed that, 94% of Maternal Mortality occur in low-income countries across the Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO 2019). Despite different implementations and efforts, mortality rate in maternal health has seemingly been high at approximately 90% in these areas. This has been an ongoing issue in countries in various developing and lower socioeconomic countries in Africa, Nigeria is no different. Most mothers tend to lose their lives as a result of some complications during pregnancy, natural or attempted abortion and childbirth (Althabe et al 1992). Even though a good number of these complications can be treatable and preventable whereas others may occur before pregnancy and with proper resources can be managed. According to Fragile States Index assessments in 2017, Nigeria had the second highest mortality rate in maternal death globally. 

        Maternal mortality has subsequently been a major Public health issue in Nigeria. Therefore, improving the health of women has been a significant and global health goal. Maternal mortality is much higher in developing countries as compared to developed countries due to the lack of inadequate medical care resources. This includes the high prevalence of poverty rate, cultural practices and beliefs, infections and lack of maternal health information due to the difference and quality healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that about 358,000 maternal deaths were recorded worldwide in the year 2008. In addition to this, 87% of this global mortality rate was recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia with 800 maternal deaths every day (WHO 2008). Nigeria recorded the second largest maternal death with an estimate of 545 deaths per 100,000 livebirths respectively. However, different studies demonstrate that the death rate in maternal mortality may vary. This is because in most rural areas, the death rate is often difficult to record due to women finding it hard to make use of health facilities. For instance, in the northern part of Nigeria, 1600 death per 100,00 livebirths was recorded and this did not count towards the national maternal death recording (Idris et al, 2010). 
        
        Nigeria is one of the top six countries where maternal mortality rate remains a problem. Despite different strategies and progression towards maternal mortality, the death rate continues to be an issue (Hogan et al, 2016). The leading cause of maternal mortality are sepsis, eclampsia, haemorrhage, hypertensive disease and complications from unsafe abortion (Abass, 2008). There are also different factors that contribute to this issue. This can be due to their socioeconomic status, education, cultural beliefs, lack of health care facilities, lack of staff etc. The well-being of women helps determine the health of many generations and helps tackle different public health challenges and how to manage the healthcare system. There has been different strategies and frameworks launched by public health interventions to focus on improving women’s health worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries (United Nations 2016). Additionally, these interventions do not only focus on the diseases affecting women but focuses on general access to proper diagnostic services, imaging and adequate systems or services.

           <p><u><b>Theoretical Framework</b></u></p>
        </h3>
    <p>This research will focus on the functionalist theory. This theory contends that individual's behaviour within the society can be shaped through the process of socialisation (Thompson, 2016).  In relation to this research paper, it basically suggests that, for a woman to have a successful maternal journey, a conscientious effort must be made to coordinate in order to achieve all important stages of pregnancy from family planning to having a safe postpartum period. In addition to this, it also explains that, in order to achieve this positive outcome, a good maternal healthcare system must be established.</p>

<h2>5.3 Recomendations</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Women must be educated especially from their teenage age about pregnancy, when to spot dangers and possible complications and what they need to do to seek medical assistant.</li>
