          <p class="text-gray">
            In Nigeria, maternal mortality remains a public health issue. About
            145 women lose their lives in childbirth each day (Piane, 2019).
            Most of these issues is associated with different factors such as
            social, unsafe healthcare practices and cultural issues. Even though
            there has been a considerable progress, there has still been an
            ongoing issue in healthcare systems to significantly meet women's
            needs. Studies have shown that proper maternal care needs to be
            implemented to ensure the wellbeing of women in Nigeria. however,
            without proper healthcare systems, the chances of maternal
            complications occurring becomes higher. This paper thus examines the
            determinant factors of maternal mortality in Nigeria. it then
            highlights some of the main nonmedical causes of maternal mortality.
            This review describes how the lack of appropriate healthcare systems
            has had a huge impact women's health and wellbeing. Subsequently,
            the study also seeks to gather different articles containing data on
            the experiences women face regarding maternal care. Both qualitative
            and quantitative research were used to conduct this review. The
            expectation of this review is to better comprehend this ongoing
            public health problem in Nigeria.

            Introduction and background
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray">
            Maternal Mortality is a term coined to describe unfortunate deaths
            of mothers due to during or after pregnancy and birth complications;
            usually happening within a month or two of bringing forth (WHO
            2005). According to World Health Organization's assessments in 2019,
            there were myriad of notable complications such as bleeding after
            birth mostly severe, gestational diseases like eclampsia and
            pre-eclampsia, diabetes, etc., infections and poverty amongst many
            others that are believed to cause these tragic deaths. A recent
            study showed that, 94% of Maternal Mortality occur in low-income
            countries across the Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO
            2019). Despite different implementations and efforts, mortality rate
            in maternal health has seemingly been high at approximately 90% in
            these areas. This has been an ongoing issue in countries in various
            developing and lower socioeconomic countries in Africa, Nigeria is
            no different. Most mothers tend to lose their lives as a result of
            some complications during pregnancy, natural or attempted abortion
            and childbirth (Althabe et al 1992). Even though a good number of
            these complications can be treatable and preventable whereas others
            may occur before pregnancy and with proper resources can be managed.
            According to Fragile States Index assessments in 2017, Nigeria had
            the second highest mortality rate in maternal death globally.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray">
            Maternal mortality has subsequently been a major public health issue
            in Nigeria. Therefore, improving the health of women has been a
            significant and global health goal. Maternal mortality is much
            higher in developing countries as compared to developed countries
            due to the lack of inadequate medical care resources. This includes
            the high prevalence of poverty rate, cultural practices and beliefs,
            infections and lack of maternal health information due to the
            difference and quality healthcare system. According to the World
            Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that about 358,000
            maternal deaths were recorded worldwide in the year 2008. In
            addition to this, 87% of this global mortality rate was recorded in
            Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia with 800 maternal deaths every day
            (WHO 2008). Nigeria recorded the second largest maternal death with
            an estimate of 545 deaths per 100,000 livebirths respectively.
            However, different studies demonstrate that the death rate in
            maternal mortality may vary. This is because in most rural areas,
            the death rate is often difficult to record due to women finding it
            hard to make use of health facilities. For instance, in the northern
            part of Nigeria, 1600 death per 100,00 livebirths was recorded and
            this did not count towards the national maternal death recording
            (Idris et al, 2010).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray">
            Nigeria is one of the top six countries where maternal mortality
            rate remains a problem. Despite different strategies and progression
            towards maternal mortality, the death rate continues to be an issue
            (Hogan et al, 2016). The leading cause of maternal mortality are
            sepsis, eclampsia, haemorrhage, hypertensive disease and
            complications from unsafe abortion (Abass, 2008). There are also
            different factors that contribute to this issue. This can be due to
            their socioeconomic status, education, cultural beliefs, lack of
            health care facilities, lack of staff etc. The well-being of women
            helps determine the health of many generations and helps tackle
            different public health challenges and how to manage the healthcare
            system. There has been different strategies and frameworks launched
            by public health interventions to focus on improving women’s health
            worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries (United
            Nations 2016). Additionally, these interventions do not only focus
            on the diseases affecting women but focuses on general access to
            proper diagnostic services, imaging and adequate systems or
            services.

            Theoretical framework
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray">
            This research will focus on the functionalist theory. This theory
            contends that individual's behaviour within the society can be
            shaped through the process of socialisation (Thompson, 2016). In
            relation to this research paper, it basically suggests that, for a
            woman to have a successful maternal journey, a conscientious effort
            must be made to coordinate in order to achieve all important stages
            of pregnancy from family planning to having a safe postpartum
            period. In addition to this, it also explains that, in order to
            achieve this positive outcome, a good maternal healthcare system
            must be established.

              <li>
                Healthcare systems in Nigeria fail to provide pregnant women and

              In the process of conducting this research paper, alongside the
              aims and objectives, what was left was the involvement that is
              required in order to establish a proper research instruction. This
              review retained information from published articles between 2000
              and 2021 which made use of both qualitative and quantitative
              method for collection of data and analysis. Studies which also
              included the objectives of the experiences of women facing
              difficulties in maternal health in Nigeria. Studies which only
              focused on: hypothetical analysis and situations, articles
              containing women seeking for fertility issues, articles in
              developed countries were excluded.

            <p class="text-gray">
              This review also focuses on women aged 18-50. It was important to
              focus on articles concerning women in Nigeria and other low-income
              countries as opposed to already developed countries due to high
              mortality rate and the lack of resources and treatment women
              receive during maternal visits. Furthermore, studies which
              subjects involve non pregnant women; and studies in which its
              analysis did not relate to maternal mortality were excluded.

            <h2 class="text-purple font-large text-center">Search Terms</h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              The process of selecting research terms allows the scope of the
              research discovery to be broadened. Therefore, it was very
              important to select the appropriate database relevant for this
              research paper. Key sources and various healthcare database such
              as PubMed, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Centre
              for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and information’s from the
              World Health Organisation (WHO) were used to support this study.
              These resources helped in the process of gathering information on
              maternal mortality in Nigeria due to their rich health related
              sources. Other databases such as Google Scholar and Medline were
              also included to gather articles and convey more information on
              maternal mortality. In addition to this, another useful method to
              consider when conducting a research question is Boolean words such
              as AND, OR and NOT which were used to retrieve relevant search
              results from different data as mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              According to Jacquette (2008), Boolean operators are used to put
              different works together in a search string in order to gain
              proper results. For example, to gain more information on maternal
              mortality and morbidity in Nigeria, the use of Boolean search
              strings will include “maternal mortality AND morbidity in Nigeria”
              so that all results will include both criteria in this area of
              study. Furthermore, keywords such as maternal mortality,
              postpartum, maternal health, pregnant women, prenatal and
              healthcare systems were used in order to detect relevant
              information to support this research. Other research and articles
              regarding the different types of care available to women in
              Nigeria were also analysed and incorporated in this paper.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Moreover, in order to retain a wide range of articles on this
              topic, it was important to work with a variation of search terms
              such as pregnancy, maternal, mortality, morbidity based in Nigeria
              and other low-income countries. At least 10 articles were chosen
              for this literature review. All articles chosen were based on both
              qualitative and quantitative research and published between 1990
              and 2021. These studies were carried out in different places such
              as hospitals, universities, care settings and other public areas
              in Nigeria.

            <p class="text-gray">
              Since maternal mortality is a sensitive topic about women's health
              and how they can potentially lose their lives if protective
              measures are not taken. It is important to consider ethical
              challenges when carrying out literature reviews. All articles used
              for this literature review included ethical approvals before
              carrying out data. Each of them had obtained informed consent from
              all participants. Some participants were given the right to
              participate voluntarily and to withdraw without any penalty.
              However, most articles included findings that were a bit
              sensitive, which was an exclusion for this review. For instance,
              some articles had information about women who had gone through
              rape and women who had lost their pregnancy due to domestic
              violence. As this can be a sensitive issue for most women, it was
              necessary to exclude this information. For the purpose of privacy
              and confidentiality, data gathered were kept anonymous.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              While conducting this review, there were various themes that
              emerged from different articles. The themes retained from these
              articles referred to the underlying issues and determinant factors
              contributing to maternal mortality in Nigeria. This includes
              sociocultural factors, the practice of unsafe abortion, women's
              education status and socioeconomic factors. These themes gathered
              from these articles also includes women's experiences in maternal
              mortality. There's a strong link between the context of this
              review and the experience women face in maternal health, and the
              themes used in this review overlaps with shared impact at both
              ends. These themes will be explained below giving examples from
              all articles used for this literature review.

              Theme 1: Sociocultural factors influencing maternal mortality
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Several studies highlighted the sociocultural factors influencing
              maternal mortality in Nigeria. In most developing countries, the
              utilization of health systems and maternal services are influenced
              by cultural factors. In Nigeria and other part of sub-Saharan
              societies, cultural practices have been known to be one of the
              factors contributing to maternal mortality (Salima, 2012).
              Sociocultural factors can influence women's decision on whether to
              reach out for care in healthcare facilities. In most African
              cultures, the knowledge to seek for adequate care mostly lies on
              their cultural beliefs and views. Some individuals tend to seek
              care from traditional healers and churches as it is their personal
              belief that, diseases can be healed spiritually rather than
              seeking for medical care (Campbell et al, 2009). For example, some
              cultures believe that consuming eggs and snails which supplies
              nutrients to a mother and their baby during pregnancy is
              forbidden. This can result in a high iron deficiency leading to
              severe anaemia and can consequently lead to death if not treated
              considering that most women lose excess blood during delivery.
            </p>

              A study conducted by Nwokocha (2003) among the people of Ibani,
              Rivers state discovered that causes of maternal mortality are on
              the increase and pregnancy outcomes (whether positive or negative)
              are being affected due to sociocultural factors. A qualitative
              study carried out by Marabele et al (2020) explained that diseases
              and other conditions are sometimes viewed differently due to
              cultural beliefs. In this study several participants between the
              ages of 30-45 gave their opinion on how cultural factors has
              contributed to their maternal health. Most participants denied the
              use of healthcare facilities due to their cultural beliefs whereas
              others stated that it was due to their socioeconomic status. For
              instance, people from the North of Oyo state have customs that
              seemingly places high values on traditional practitioner in charge
              of pre and post pregnancy almost in every community. Such that
              when pregnant women who see blood spots during their 2nd trimester
              is made to believe that their enemies want to take the
              child/children away and use him/her against the mother. Therefore,
              instead of seeking medical attention or advice from a qualified
              doctor they will rather decline. Hence, most end up bleeding
              excessively before being rushed to hospital. Consequentially,
              losing babies at 22weeks could have been avoided if seen by the
              obstetrician or gynaecologist few days earlier or had 65-75% of
              the maternal health information.

            <p class="text-gray">
              According to Cometto (2012), in most Islamic homes, women needed
              permission from their spouses to live their homes to seek medical
              treatment. In addition to this, others had no choice than to seek
              for female doctors to attend to their pregnancy treatment.
              Furthermore, most women find it to access health facilities due to
              poor road networks. Due to the poor nature of some of these roads,
              pregnant women are often carried at the backs of people to travel
              long distance to healthcare facilities. In addition to this, due
              to these poor road networks, it is difficult for transport
              services such as ambulances to help these women access health
              facilities. As a result of this, most women have no choice than to
              give birth at home traditional herbalist and other untrained
              people such as family, friends etc. The delays can cause
              complications and lead to possible death.

              Theme 2: the practice of unsafe abortion due to its illegalisation
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              The linkages between unsafe abortion and maternal mortality fell
              across various studies. The practice of unsafe abortion has been
              one of the common causes of maternal mortality in Nigeria.
              Abortion plays a huge role in the reproductive health of women in
              Nigeria. Unsafe abortion often leads to maternal complications
              such as sepsis, haemorrhage and trauma. This has been a huge
              public health issue in most developing countries (Frank et al,
              2017). According to the Criminal Law of Lagos State (2011),
              abortion itself is restricted in Nigeria, hence, the need to
              practise unsafe abortion to terminate unwanted pregnancy has
              become a necessity unless done to save a mother's life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              A recent study carried out by Byrne et al (2021) consisted of 1144
              women in several Nigerian state. Most women who participated in
              this study reported that their abortion experience was either
              carried out by a friend or unskilled provider due to its
              illegalisation. Moreover, another study carried out by Saidu et al
              (200) explained that participants who were asked about their views
              on unsafe abortion had poor knowledge of the process of abortion
              though many knew women who had died and had complications due to
              unsafe abortion. In addition to this, policymakers who gave their
              opinion on this study suggested that abortion should remain
              illegal in Nigeria due to their cultural beliefs whereas others
              supported that it should be legal in cases of rape and incest and
              women should have the choice to decide what they want to do with
              their pregnancy. Other participants recommended different
              strategies to help reduce maternal mortality in Nigeria. This
              included the use of contraceptives, providing women with sexual
              education, supports groups to empower women, improving the
              healthcare system in Nigeria and providing free pregnancy care to
              all women.

              Theme 3: The education status of women and pregnancy outcomes
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              The education level of women is thought to be important for
              treating and preventing poor health outcomes (McNichol, 2003). In
              most cases, women who are educated are said to develop better
              autonomy to act on health knowledge and skills, control women's
              fertility and help improve maternal health in Nigeria. Women in
              African societies are known to be the ones to keep the household
              and sometimes may not consider taking care of themselves as a
              priority. Educated women are often known to be an investment for
              the family (Anugwom, 2009). A study carried out by Babalola (2009)
              found the Significant association between education and the use of
              maternal services.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              The concept if maternal education and its effects of women in most
              developing countries has been an issue of discussions for
              researchers. According to the World Health Organisation as
              reported by Renket and Nutbean (2001). Education in health often
              represents the cognitive skills that determines the ability to
              gain access and to understand the use of information in ways to
              promote good health. a study carried out by Asogwa et al
              emphasised that illiteracy plays a huge role in women's health.
              the study explained that most women are often unaware of how
              important antenatal care is about, so they tend to avoid them
              during pregnancy. Some participants in this study explained that
              when women are thought about the importance education and
              pregnancy, they often see it as a show-off to them.

              Theme 4: Poverty and the low status of women
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Another theme that emerged from different studies was the level of
              poverty associated with maternal health in Nigeria. Poverty is one
              of the major causes of maternal mortality Nigeria. Poverty can be
              defined as the situation in which individuals needs necessary for
              survival are so limited excluding them from minimum way of life in
              countries in which they live in (Safra, 1998). It is usually
              identified as one of the major factors to human development. Most
              women in poverty do not receive proper medical care due to their
              cost of living and their inability to afford proper maternal
              treatment. According to the Nigerian Demographic and health survey
              (2015), 30 percent of women in Nigeria are known to receiving loan
              for treatment whiles 24 percent of these women have difficulties
              in accessing transportation to health facilities due to their
              socioeconomic status.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              A study carried out by Asogwa et al (2021) explained that poverty
              is one of the reasons why women do not make use of maternal
              facilities. Participants who were involved in this study stated
              that most women avoid going to the hospital due to their financial
              status. Most women perceive the hospital as a place for people
              with higher income so they would rather use local herbs or visit
              unskilled providers. According to Akinola, who is the chair of
              Gynaecology in Nigeria suggests that 20% of women in Nigeria give
              birth by themselves, while other 25% only refer to traditional
              attendants, most of whom cannot handle birth complications but
              fail to refer women to trained personnel (Wakabi, 2013). As a
              result of this, about 145 women lose their lives during and after
              childbirth.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Furthermore, Nkegbe et al (2017) investigated the link between
              poverty and malaria and its influence on maternal mortality.
              Malaria remains a public health burden in Nigeria, causing about
              200-500 million illnesses and an estimate of 1-2 million death
              rate annually (Kaiser, 2013). This is a preventable illness yet
              one of the common serious diseases worldwide. According to the
              World Health Organisation (2017), malaria is one of the major
              causes of maternal mortality in Nigeria. This leads to anaemia,
              low birth weight after birth and preterm birth. Studies have shown
              that socioeconomic factors play a major role in malaria. Akpa
              (2019) found that, pregnant women who had partners with better
              education were more likely to receive better treatment to fight
              malaria as compared to other women.

              Theoretical Discussion
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              As explained above, the functionalist theory was chosen for this
              literature review as it determines how the social world must work
              together to provide a healthy environment. In many parts of the
              world, women are maltreated during childbirth (Bohren et al,
              2015). This can be due to their socioeconomic status, education,
              their role in society, class, gender etc. The health of most women
              and their children is disadvantaged through different social
              inequalities.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Typically, the main assumption of the functionalist theory is
              based on the concept that, society can be explained as whole
              (Okafor, 2015). A prominent theorist like Durkheim, Herbert
              Spencer, Wilbert Moore explained that in order to understand the
              social phenomena, it is important to consider the needs of the
              social organism. So, for a certain population to survive, social
              institutions must work together to promote a healthy stability and
              solidarity within the society. According to these functionalists,
              society is a complex system made up of interconnected structures.
              However, this demonstrate that, for societies to adapt and
              function properly there must be quality and affordable healthcare
              systems (Okafor et al, 2015).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Furthermore, Talcott Parsons who was specialised in the
              sociological way of thinking argued that any social system
              consists of four basic functional requirements: goal attainment,
              adaptation, latency and integration (Trueman, 2015). He explained
              that for the society to survive properly, these four prerequisites
              should be seen as a problem and therefore must be reviewed. These
              four prerequisites are used to explain cultural and social
              imperatives.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Based on the theory explained above, it is possible to understand
              that maternal mortality and maternal healthcare can be controlled
              in Nigeria. Maternal mortality and other pregnancy complications
              in women are due to different aspects of cultural, social and
              economic systems. Additionally, the reproductive period of a woman
              can be influenced by both sociocultural and biological factors.
              For example, the stages of pregnancy must require an effective
              plan and adequate care in order to avoid complications during
              pregnancy and after birth as any little mistake can affect the
              outcome of the pregnancy. In reference to the functionalist's
              view, this can either affect the life of the mother, the child or
              both. To assist this theory, an article conducted by McCourt
              (2014) explained that social theory helps to analyse the social
              determinants of health and the ways in which women's socioeconomic
              status and their access to education and power can play a major
              role in their health status and their wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              According to Akokuwebe (2016), the healthcare system in Nigeria
              has been faced with a disturbing maternal mortality and morbidity
              during pregnancy and after. The healthcare sector in Nigeria has
              been haunted by the type of quality services people receive,
              including the shortage of drugs, inadequate infrastructures,
              unfriendly staff and poor attitudes towards patients (Hodges,
              2001). In some hospitals, there are shortage of equipment and lack
              of supplies such as weighing scales, thermometers, waste bins,
              sphygmomanometers etc. Many hospitals do not have regular
              electricity supply due to the inability to manage a generator.
              Most patient are being asked to provide their own water due to the
              shortage of water supplies. The Nigeria government spend roughly
              about 80 percent of the country's resources to provide a better
              healthcare system for its citizens, yet the social system fails to
              deliver better healthcare needs for women at a critical time of
              their lives. There is a need for the Nigerian government to invest
              more finances to support the healthcare system and to allow
              primary healthcare especially in the rural areas of Nigeria to be
              accessible and affordable to promote better healthcare.

            <p class="text-gray">
              Despite gradual improvements and approaches set to help women
              access adequate health resources, there has still been an ongoing
              difficulty in meeting the healthcare needs of women at a critical
              time of their lives, mostly during their adolescent and old age;
              from difficulties in accessing proper equipment and technologies
              for clear diagnoses, to the lack of medication and reliable
              treatment, the ongoing issues of healthcare in Nigeria has been
              either stagnant or worsen. Suggesting that the efforts made to
              help these issues have either been improperly implemented (Thomas
              2022).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              This review was conducted to identify some of the main causes of
              maternal mortality in Nigeria. The introduction and other findings
              of this literature review confirms the different causes associated
              with maternal health in Nigeria. As explained previously, maternal
              mortality does not only consist of childbirth but rather prenatal
              and postpartum care. These components are essential for making
              sure that mothers and their children are safe. Furthermore, one of
              the main factors that was found through studies was socioeconomic
              status of women in Nigeria. According to Lanre (2008), it is
              proven that a lot of women do not receive proper medical care due
              to the lack of services they receive in their residency and their
              inability to afford healthcare services because the prices may be
              too high. As a result of this, a lot of women do not make use of
              healthcare services due to the level of care provided or they
              believe that high quality care is not being delivered to meet
              their needs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Furthermore, other findings revealed the practice of unsafe
              abortions as one of the contributing factors of maternal mortality
              in Nigeria. Women undergo dangerous unsafe abortion performed by
              unskilled providers putting women at risk due to abortion being
              illegal in Nigeria. Moreover, eight studies used to conduct this
              review showed that unsafe abortion contributes to at least 20% of
              maternal mortality with an assisted complications such as anaemia,
              sepsis, ruptured uterus and in most cases, complications affecting
              the reproductive system.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              In theory, all ten studies used for this review reported poverty
              as one of the main causes of maternal mortality. It was found
              that, the Nigerian economy has one of the largest productions of
              oil and gas and supplies to other countries (BBC, 2002). Nigeria
              has the potential to build a wealthy economy and to provide proper
              healthcare systems for women in the country. However, the
              widespread of poverty has been a problem despite its natural
              resources to a point where Nigeria has been placed among one of
              the twenty poorest countries in the world (BBC, 2002). Regardless
              of its wealth in oil, earning an estimate of 280 billion U.S
              dollars, Nigeria has one of the highest maternal mortalities
              globally. The healthcare system in Nigerian has been in a dismal
              state past few years due to their poor socioeconomic state and
              their crises of leadership. The Universal Rights of Childbearing
              Women Charter declares that every woman has their right to be
              respected and dignified when it comes to their sexual and
              reproductive health including childbirth (White Ribbon Alliance,
              2013). Poor maternity care profoundly influences the health and
              future of women as well as their child and generations to come. In
              cases where women have difficulties in societal acceptance and
              discrimination based on their socioeconomic status, they are more
              likely to be treated poorly in health facilities.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Furthermore, the Nigerian government hopes to provide measures to
              improve women's healthcare and to reduce the countries burden in
              maternal mortality rate (Wakabi, 2013). Nigerian officials have
              made considerable effort to help reduce the burden of maternal
              mortality. For instance, these efforts include free healthcare
              system for women especially those in rural areas, deploying
              midwives to areas of need, offering women with free contraceptives
              etc (Chukwu, 2011). According to Nigerian Healthcare Minister
              Onyebuchi Chukwu, there has been efforts made to jumpstart
              different campaigns to improve the healthcare systems in Nigeria.
              For instance, a health insurance scheme launched to help women
              access better healthcare treatment. This health insurance scheme
              mostly targets population in rural areas to help those struggling
              to afford healthcare treatment (Wakabi, 2013).

              The findings of this review and the outlined themes brings clarity
              on the determinant factors women face during and after pregnancy.
              Maternal mortality in Nigeria remains a public health problem and
              requires a substantial improvement. This review drew on relevant
              theories that helps to understand the reason for these factors and
              human behaviour towards maternal mortality. Unfortunately, women
              in Nigeria are more likely to suffer from pregnancy related
              problems and complications as compared to other women in developed
              countries due to the ongoing death rate in maternal mortality. It
              is very important to consider women’s health outcomes for them to
              feel protected and safe when seeking for medical attention. In
              order to improve women’s quality of health and to help reduce
              maternal mortality, the barriers to accessing proper healthcare
              services must be tackled at all levels to enable quality
              healthcare systems and treatments. It is also important to
              understand and address certain factors such as socioeconomic,
              sociocultural and other health related issues that make it
              difficult for women to seek maternal care at a very critical time
              of their life.

              Furthermore, the Global Strategy for Women and Children’s Health
              is among one of the strategies that was lunched by the UN
              Secretary General. This was established between the years
              2010-2030 to significantly draw the public’s attention and
              contributions towards improving maternal mortality and women’s
              health in general (Mariani et al 2017). This strategy provides
              women, adolescents and children with proper safeguarding for
              transformative change and helps women attain their human rights,
              even in the most difficult time of their life. It also provides
              women with good quality services, stronger healthcare systems,
              skilled and equipped healthcare workers etc.

            <h2 class="text-purple font-large text-center">Limitations</h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              A limitation of this study was the different articles and
              literatures included to get a clear understanding of women's
              experiences in maternal mortality. Although, different studies
              were found between late 1980s to 1990s. It was important to focus
              on studies published from early 2000s to date. Furthermore, the
              exclusion of medical studies that were related to maternal
              mortality containing rich information of women's experience which
              could have been useful, is considered as a limitation for this
              study.Despite these limitations, the findings and articles used
              for this review gives an understanding of why maternal mortality
              continue to be problem and the different factors that contribute
              to impacts women's health in Nigeria.

              Personal Reflection
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Upon commencing this review, I was a bit nervous considering how
              big this assignment was going to be. I didn't know how to begin
              this review. I was a bit limited to resources and information due
              to my participation in class and online lectures. I learn better
              in class than online, so that was a bit challenging for me.
              However, I’m very too determined so I decided to go over and over
              on the pre-recorded lectures to better understand and ensure that
              I am on track. At first, I began this project by understanding
              what I needed to do and what to include after picking this topic.
              I made sure to read, understand and revise on the theories and
              different frameworks involved on this topic.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Furthermore, I thought the biggest hurdle in carrying out this big
              project was having to put together ideas, search for relevant
              articles and drafting of the review; however, the most difficult
              part I felt was a bit of a hustle was to incorporate the research
              and relevant articles into this review. I made use of the library
              to gain more database and ideas for this paper. I also made sure
              to keep in contact with colleagues and most importantly the module
              leader to make sure I am on track. I believe my biggest
              accomplishment was completing this whole literature review. Having
              to look back the time invested and carrying out wider reading to
              achieve a greater outcome. This review mainly focuses on the
              health of women in Nigeria. I spent a lot of time making sure that
              I understand the healthcare systems in Nigeria and the many
              articles written on maternal mortality.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Overall, I personally believe that I did very well on this
              literature review. It is one of the best papers I have had to
              carry out. I have learnt a lot from it; especially what women go
              through in other parts of the world and the extra measures they go
              through in order to have a healthy living that has been taken away
              from them. Moreover, I had a very limited time due to personal
              circumstances, but I made sure to plan beforehand. I personally
              feel like my vocabulary and structuring has improved tremendously.
              I have gained the knowledge on how to cite and reference
              correctly. At the end, I was pleasantly surprised about the
              outcome of this paper. I enjoyed and learned a lot from it.
